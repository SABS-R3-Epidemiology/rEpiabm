    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed guide for running an `rEpiabm` simulation using a realistic population generated by `EpiGeoPop`. It then walks through the post-simulation analysis, including calculating the time-varying reproduction number ($R_t$) with `EpiEstim` and comparing it to the simulation's internal calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes you have already followed the setup instructions in the `README.md` to install `rEpiabm` and its dependencies."

    "## Step 1: Configure and Run the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to run the main simulation using a pre-generated population file (e.g., for Andorra). The `simulation_epigeopop.r` script handles this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the simulation parameters directly within the `simulation_epigeopop.r` script. The most common parameters to change are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `country`: The name of the country/region you are simulating (e.g., `\"Andorra\"`). This determines which data folder to use.\n",
    "- `simulation_duration`: The total number of days the simulation will run.\n",
    "- `initial_infected`: The number of individuals who are infectious at the start of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open  and adjust the parameters as needed.\n",
    "2. Run `simulation_epigeopop.r` to execute the script. This will generate several output files in `data/<your_country>/simulation_outputs/` (replacing <your_country> with your region of interest)."

    "\n",
    "Next, we will process the raw simulation output with the `epiestim_epigeopop.r` script. This script calculates the daily incidence and generation time distribution, then uses the `EpiEstim` package to estimate $R_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Run 'epiestim_epigeopop.r' to execute the EpiEstim analysis. The results will be saved in `data/<your_country>/simulation_outputs/epiestim/`."

    "- **`Generation_plot.png`**: A plot showing the probability distribution of the time between successive infections.\n",
    "- **`epiestim_detailed_plot_np.png`**: A plot of the estimated $R_t$ over time, with a 95% confidence interval. This is the main output of this step.\n",

    "\n",
    "The second script, `compare_r_numbers.r`, is designed to compare the $R_t$ we just calculated with `EpiEstim` against the $R_t$ that was calculated internally by the `rEpiabm` simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge is that `EpiEstim` calculates an **instantaneous** $R_t$ (who gets infected *today*), while `rEpiabm` tracks a **case** $R_t$ (who infected whom). The script performs a mathematical conversion to make them comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit the file `compare_r_numbers.r` to ensure both directories point to the correct locations, they should read (replacing <your_country> with your region of interest):\n",
    "    - epiestim_dir <- \"rEpiabm/data/<your_country>/simulation_outputs/epiestim\"\n",
    "    - epiabm_dir <- \"rEpiabm/data/<your_country>/simulation_outputs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run `compare_r_numbers.r` to execute the comparison script. It will generate and save a final comparison plot."
