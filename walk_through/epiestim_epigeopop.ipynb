    "# Epigeopop Simulation and Analysis Walk-through\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed guide for running an `rEpiabm` simulation using a realistic population generated by `EpiGeoPop`. It then walks through the post-simulation analysis, including calculating the time-varying reproduction number ($R_t$) with `EpiEstim` and comparing it to the simulation's internal calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide assumes you have already followed the setup instructions in the `README.md` to install `rEpiabm` and its dependencies."

    "## Step 1: Configure and Run the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to run the main simulation using a pre-generated population file (e.g., for Andorra). The `simulation_epigeopop.r` script handles this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the simulation parameters directly within the `simulation_epigeopop.r` script. The most common parameters to change are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `country`: The name of the country/region you are simulating (e.g., `\"Andorra\"`). This determines which data folder to use.\n",
    "- `simulation_duration`: The total number of days the simulation will run.\n",
    "- `initial_infected`: The number of individuals who are infectious at the start of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open and adjust the parameters passed to the run_complete_simulation function as needed.\n",
    "2. Run `simulation_epigeopop.r` to execute the script. This will generate several output files in `data/<your_country>/epiestim/` (replacing <your_country> with your region of interest)."

    "## Step 2: Run the EpiEstim Post-Simulation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will process the raw simulation output with the `epiestim_epigeopop.r` script. This script calculates the daily incidence and generation time distribution, then uses the `EpiEstim` package to estimate $R_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can specify parameters according to their requirements. For example, if the simulation is run for 60 days, the first_day should be set to 2, the last_day is 60 and the sliding_window can be either daily, weekly or another custom amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit the file to ensure both directories point to the correct locations, they should read (replacing <your_country> with your region of interest):\n",
    "    - input_dir <- \"data/<your_country>/simulation_outputs\"\n",
    "    - output_dir <- \"data/<your_country>/epiestim\" \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Amend parameters at the top of the file as needed - remember to amend the country to your region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run 'epiestim_epigeopop.r' to execute the EpiEstim analysis. The results will be saved in `data/<your_country>/epiestim/`."

    "## Step 3: Compare $R_t$ Estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "The second script, `compare_r_numbers.r`, is designed to compare the $R_t$ we just calculated with `EpiEstim` against the $R_t$ that was calculated internally by the `rEpiabm` simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key challenge is that `EpiEstim` calculates an **instantaneous** $R_t$ (who gets infected *today*), while `rEpiabm` tracks a **case** $R_t$ (who infected whom). The script performs a mathematical conversion to make them comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Edit the file `compare_r_numbers.r` to ensure both directories point to the correct locations, they should read (replacing <your_country> with your region of interest):\n",
    "    - epiestim_dir <- \"rEpiabm/data/<your_country>/epiestim\"\n",
    "    - epiabm_dir <- \"rEpiabm/data/<your_country>/simulation_outputs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change the parameters according to your parameters specified in `epiestim_epigeopop.r` file. For example, first_day is day 8 (the last day of the first sliding window+1), and last_day to 60, the last day of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run `compare_r_numbers.r` to execute the comparison script. It will generate and save a final comparison plot."
